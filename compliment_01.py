'''

1. On a scale of 1 to 10 (where 10 is the hardest), how would you rate this lab?
I'd give it a 4 at best.



2. What was the hardest part of this lab?
I've been so conditioned to do the def main() thing that I immediately tried to do that. (it did not work.)
Once I got off that idea, it was actually pretty simple.
